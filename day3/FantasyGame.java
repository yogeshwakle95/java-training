/*Exercise 4 — Fantasy Game
In a new role-playing fantasy game players must design their character by picking a point value 
for each of three characteristics: 
• Strength, from 1 to 10
• Health, from 1 to 10
• Luck, from 1 to 10
Write a program that asks for a name for the character and asks for the point value of for each of 
the three characteristics. However, the total points must be less than 15. If the total exceeds 15, 
then 5 points are assigned to each characteristic 
Welcome to Yertle's Quest
