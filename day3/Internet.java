/*Exercise 1 â€” Internet Delicatessen
You have been asked to write a program for the Sam and Ella Delicatessen. The program takes 
daily orders from the Internet. It asks for the item, its price in cents, and if express delivery is 
wanted. The program writes out the order and the charges. Regular delivery for items under $10 
is $2.00; for items $10 or more delivery is free. For express delivery add $3.00. 
Enter the item: Tuna Salad
Enter the price: 4.50
Overnight delivery (0==no, 1==yes): 1
Invoice:
 Tuna Salad 4.50
 delivery 5.00
 total 9.50*/
