/*Exercise 2 
The following program uses primitive data type double: 
public class DoubleJeopardy
{
 public static void main ( String[] args )
 {
 double value = 32;
 System.out.println("A double: " + value);
 }
}
In this program, value is the name for a variable that uses the double data type to represent 
floating point numbers. Recall that this data type uses 64 bits. 
It is perfectly OK to use the name value in this and in the previous program. A variable name 
helps describe what you want the program to do. It does not permanently reserve part of 
computer memory for any particular use. 
Compile and run the program. Does its output (what it puts on the screen) differ from the output 
of the the previous exercise? 
Change the 32 to 32.0 and see if that makes a difference when you compile and run the program.*/

public class doublejeopardy
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
double value =32.0;

System.out.println("A double " + value);

}
}
