/*Exercise 1 
The following program uses primitive data type short: 
public class Shortfall
{
 public static void main ( String[] args )
 {
 short value = 32;
 System.out.println("A short: " + value);
 }
}
value in this program is a variableâ€”a name for a section of memory that holds data using a 
particular data type. In this case value is the name for 16 bits of main memory that uses short
to represent an integer. (The next chapter says much more about variables.) This program puts 
the value 32 into value. Then it writes out: 
A short: 32
In other words, that line of the program examines the variable and writes out what it finds*/


public class shortfall
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
int value =35000;

System.out.println("A SHORT " + value);

}
}
